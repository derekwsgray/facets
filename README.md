# Facets - Web Components

Facets provides a set of Web Components (framework-agnostic) for 'faceting' your data, i.e. displaying bucketed data and providing the interactions with which to select and filter it.

1. For using facets in Javascript/Typescript see [Using Facets](./USING_FACETS.md).
2. For styling existing facets using CSS variables see [CSS Variables](./VARIABLES.md).
3. For notes on developing new facets or debugging facet code see [Development](./DEVELOPMENT.md).

## Examples

Examples are hosted at https://unchartedsoftware.github.io/facets/basic.html but can also be built [locally](./DEVELOPMENT.md).

## Note on Browser Support

Facets 3.x supported old browsers such as IE that didn't support CSS variables. 4.x drops support for those older browsers.
