The Facets library is split in five packages:
1. `facets-core` contains all the components necessary to start using facets in your project
2. `facets-plugins` is a collection of components that extend facets' behavior, look and feel
3. `facets-docs` documentation and examples live here
4. `facets-builder` tool to create and customize facets (under construction, Facets 4+ feature)

The only packages published to the registry are `facets-core` and `facets-plugins` 


## Installation

Use `yarn` to install the desired packages:
```shell script
$ yarn add @uncharted.software/facets-core
$ yarn add @uncharted.software/facets-plugins
```
or `npm`:
```shell script
$ npm install @uncharted.software/facets-core
$ npm install @uncharted.software/facets-plugins
```


## Usage

The documentation is not hosted anywhere at the moment but can be accessed by building the project and running the
`facets-docs` package.


Check out or download this repo, then, from the repo's root folder run the following commands:
```shell script
$ yarn install
$ yarn build
```

You can now run the documentation:
```shell script
$ cd packages/facets-docs
$ yarn start
```

On your browser navigate to http://localhost:5173/


## Development

Check out or download this repo, then, from the repo's root folder run the following commands:
```shell script
$ yarn install
$ yarn build
```

Start the `watch` script for the packages that you will be working on (usually `factes-core` and `facets-plugins`):
```shell script
$ cd packages/facets-core
$ yarn watch
```

To develop locally, run the `facets-docs` package and use it as a testbed:
```shell script
$ cd packages/facets-docs
$ yarn start
```
On your browser navigate to http://localhost:8090/  
Changes to the code will refresh the browser automatically.
  
To develop in your own app, link ALL the published facets packages to your app, from the root of the Facets repo run: 
```shell script
$ cd packages/css-options
$ yarn link
$ cd ../facets-core
$ yarn link
$ cd ../facets-plugins
$ yarn link
```

Then, from the root of your project run:
```shell script
$ yarn link @uncharted.software/css-options @uncharted.software/facets-core @uncharted.software/facets-plugins
```

Start (or re-start) your project and continue with development.
